# refresh-page-tool
This is a basic single file HTML and Javascript tool that will refresh a web page according to your parameters. I wrote this years ago to satisfy a need for automated refresh in an environment where no browser extensions/add-ons were allowed and figured I should put it up here in case someone could use it in the future.
